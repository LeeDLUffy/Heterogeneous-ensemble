# Heterogeneous-ensemble

To perform a predictive analysis using a heterogeneous ensemble on the insurance dataset, we can follow the following steps:


-Import the necessary libraries and load the insurance dataset.


-Split the dataset into training and testing sets.


-Create different models using various algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines, and gradient boosting.


-Train each model on the training set.


-Predict the target variable using each model on the testing set.


-Combine the predictions of each model using a weighted average or a voting mechanism.


-Evaluate the performance of the ensemble model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


-Tune the parameters of each model and ensemble to optimize the performance.

In this code, we first load the insurance dataset and split it into features (X) and target (y). We then split the data into training and testing sets. Next, we define a column transformer to preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding and scaling numerical variables using standardization. We also define three different base models: a decision tree regressor, a support vector machine regressor, and a multi-layer perceptron regressor. We then define a heterogeneous ensemble by combining these three models using a voting regressor. We create a pipeline that applies the column transformer and the ensemble to the data, and we fit the pipeline to the training data. Finally, we evaluate the pipeline on the testing data using the R-squared metric.
